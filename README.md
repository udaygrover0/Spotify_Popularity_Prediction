# Spotify Popularity Prediction Project

This project is a comprehensive analysis and prediction model focused on understanding the factors that contribute to the popularity of songs on Spotify. The project includes statistical and hypothesis testing, machine learning predictions, and an interactive Streamlit dashboard for visual exploration.

This project was undertaken as part of an academic assignment at the Fore School of Management, New Delhi, aimed at providing students with practical experience in data analysis, machine learning, and business analytics.

## Project Overview

This project aims to analyze the features of songs on Spotify to uncover key insights into what drives a song's popularity. By exploring the relationships between various musical features (such as danceability, energy, and tempo) and the track's popularity, the project provides data-driven recommendations that could inform artists, producers, and marketers on how to create and promote popular music. The ultimate goal is to enhance the understanding of musical trends and optimize strategies for releasing successful tracks.

## Project Components

- **Streamlit Dashboard**:  
  An interactive dashboard that allows users to explore various song features and their relationships with popularity. The dashboard includes visualizations for top artists, albums, word clouds, radar charts, and more.
